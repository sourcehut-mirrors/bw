/* This is an example of how to use libpng to read and write PNG files.
 * The file libpng-manual.txt is much more verbose then this.  If you have
 * not read it, do so first.  This was designed to be a starting point of an
 * implementation.  This is not officially part of libpng, is hereby placed
 * in the public domain, and therefore does not require a copyright notice.
 *
 * However, having said that we must at least provide code that works
 * in that is does some libpng operations correctly and delivers a 
 * valid result.
 *
 * The simple, but restricted approach to reading a PNG file or data stream
 * requires just two function calls, as in the following complete program.
 * Writing a file needs just one function call, so long as the data has an
 * appropriate layout.
 *
 * The following code reads PNG image data from a file and writes it, in a
 * potentially new format, to a new file.
 * 
 * This code provides little or no error checking. 
 * For a more realistic version see contrib/examples/pngtopng.c
