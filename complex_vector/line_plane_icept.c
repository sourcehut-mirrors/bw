/* Here we expect to receive some point lp0 which is the "origin"

 * not be normalized.
 *
 * We also receive a point on a plane pl0 and a normal vector pn
 * which might not be normalized. Optionally we may receive some
 * linearly independant basis vectors plu and plv which must be
 * orthogonal to pn.  If we do not receive plu and plv then we
 * must compute some reasonable basis vectors in the plane.
 *
 * The return value will indicate success or not. In the event of
