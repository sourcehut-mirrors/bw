## About

This project aims to create a versatile multimedia player application.

The application is built using C99 and leverages X11 for graphics rendering.

Our goal here is to be portable and cross-platform to FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, etc.
Note: right now all it does it plays a sound and shows a sine wave. More to come.

### Key Features

- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, PowerPC)
- MP3 playback support
- Basic UI controls for navigation and volume adjustment
- Modular design for easy expansion of features

## Features

### Audio Playback

- Supports MP3 format (more to come)
- Basic playback control (play/pause, stop, next/previous track)
- Volume adjustment

### User Interface

- Simple X11-based UI
- Keyboard shortcuts for easy navigation

### Platform targets

Linux
FreeBSD / OpenBSD / NetBSD
Solaris
